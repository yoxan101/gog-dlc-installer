# üì¶ GOG DLC Installer

**‚û°Ô∏è Ready-to-use executable available in [Releases](link_do_releases)!** üöÄ

This project is a tool designed to automate the installation of GOG DLCs, streamlining the process of installing multiple executable (.exe) files sequentially.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

-   **Automated Installation**: Installs multiple .exe files from a selected directory in sequence.
-   **Target Directory Selection**: Allows users to specify the main installation folder.
-   **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
-   **Logging**: Detailed logs of the installation process.
-   **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of the installation progress.
-   **Installation Cancellation**: Ability to halt the installation process at any time.
-   **Compilation to .exe**: Option to compile the script into a single executable file using PyInstaller.

## üìã Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Libraries: `tkinter`, `Pillow (PIL)`, `psutil`
-   PyInstaller (optional, for .exe compilation)

## üì¶ Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```

2.  Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install pillow psutil
    ```

3.  (Optional) Install PyInstaller:

    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

1.  Run the `installer_gui.py` script:

    ```bash
    python installer_gui.py
    ```

2.  Select the directory containing the installer files, the target directory, and the first installer file.
3.  Click "Start install" to begin the installation.
4.  (Optional) To compile to a .exe file, run the `combine_and_compile.py` script.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script is composed of two primary components:

-   `installer_logic.py`: Contains the installation logic, process handling, logging, and cancellation functions.
-   `installer_gui.py`: Tkinter-based GUI that enables directory and file selection and displays the installation progress.
-   `combine_and_compile.py`: Script that merges the logic and GUI into a single file, encodes graphic files to base64, and compiles to a .exe.

## üìÑ Logs

Detailed installation logs are saved to the `installer.log` file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

-   Ensure that the installer files are compatible with the selected target directory.
-   Cancelling the installation may leave partially installed software.
-   This program may be flagged by Windows Defender or other antivirus software due to its automation of executable files. If this occurs, you may need to add an exception or temporarily disable your antivirus software.
